Lesson plans for the CCA 24-25 robotics academic year.

## Module: Manufacturing Design Elements

In manufacturing robotics, we need to establish some basics elements of design.

- Gripping:
  - Clever Contraptions: #22, 23, 25
  - Idea Book: p 96, 244
    - Challenge: grip the red ball. But make them sit together for 5 minutes to discuss ideas. Then break out and build.
- Gears:
  - Simple Machines: #1, 7, 12, 15, 18
  - Idea Book: the last one above directly moves toward #87
- Lifting:
  - Clever Contraptions: #14, 16
  - Idea Book: pg 104
- Turn Tables:
  - Simple Machines: #38, 39, 40
  - Idea Book: pg 50

Now let's look at some full builds using these basic design elements:

- Fork Lift: [instructions](https://www.onekitprojects.com/51515/forklift)
- Crane: [instructions](https://www.onekitprojects.com/51515/crane). This req's string

Introduce the degree of freedom concept.

Challenge build: build a 2DOF robot that grips a ball and lifts it over a wall. The arm may not be on a vehicle; it must be stationary.
