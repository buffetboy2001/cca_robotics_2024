# Robotics @ CCA in 2024

Lesson plans for the [CCA](https://cornerstoneclassicalroanoke.org) 24-25 robotics academic year.

## Module: Manufacturing Design Elements

In manufacturing robotics, we need to establish some basics elements of design before diving into building full robots.

- Gripping:
  - Clever Contraptions: #22, 23, 25
  - Idea Book: p 96, 244
    - Challenge: grip the red ball. But make them sit together for 5 minutes to discuss ideas. Then break out and build.

- Lifting:
  - Clever Contraptions: #14, 16
  - Idea Book: pg 104

- Gears:
  - Simple Machines: #1, 7, 12, 15, 18
  - Idea Book: the last one above directly moves toward #87

- Turn Tables:
  - Simple Machines: #38, 39, 40
  - Idea Book: pg 50

Now let's look at some full builds using these basic design elements:

- Fork Lift: [instructions](https://www.onekitprojects.com/51515/forklift)
- Crane: [instructions](https://www.onekitprojects.com/51515/crane). This req's string
- Color Sorter: [instructions](https://www.onekitprojects.com/51515/color-sorter). This one is very hhelpful since it is an simpler sorter concept to dig into prior to introducing the advanced sorter below.

Introduce the degree of freedom concept.

Challenge build: build a 2DOF robot that grips a ball and lifts it over a wall. The arm may not be on a vehicle; it must be stationary.

**Uncategorized Content**:

- the students are interested in building the rubik's cube sorter in the activity book. Need to figure out where this fits.

## Module: Playing with Machine Learning

Using just lego elements, we'll dive into ML to learn how this is helpful in robots designed for manufacturing tasks.

- [Lego Tutorial for Audio Recognition](https://youtu.be/JdgSHBjH3qc?si=BgehOxZQHk01J1Uy)
- [Lego Tutorial for Video Recognition](https://youtu.be/xnxv1vuKoSs?si=yCFe_YxGfnc7AYXj)

Challenge build: a robot that picks up the red ball but rejects anything else presented to it, is activated by a voice command.

## Bigger Topics in Robotics

I want to introduce these as topics, but not dive in.

- Medical Robotics

- Flying Robots

- Cleaning Robots
  - Vacuum
  - Lawnmower

- Anthropological Robots
  - _I, Robot_ introduces philosophical concerns about robots
  - _The Jettsons_ also
